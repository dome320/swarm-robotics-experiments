# Swarm Robotics Experiments

This repository documents my exploration of swarm robotics and autonomous agent behaviors using the RobotSwarmSimulator (RSS).

The goal is to build reproducible experiments, starting from classical swarm behaviors (e.g. Lévy walks, clustering) and progressing toward learned controllers and neuromorphic approaches.

## Structure
- `rss-basics/` – Setup notes and RSS tutorial experiments
- `levy-walk/` – Lévy walk controller implementation and analysis
- `nn-behaviors/` – Traditional neural network-based swarm behaviors
- `notes/` – Research notes and observations

This work is independent and does not include restricted or proprietary lab code.
