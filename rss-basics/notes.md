# RSS Setup Notes

This folder documents my setup and initial exploration of the RobotSwarmSimulator.

## Goals
- Understand agent update loops
- Learn how controllers are implemented
- Run baseline swarm behaviors

## Status
- [ ] RSS installed
- [ ] Example simulation running
- [ ] Custom controller added

## Basic RSS Usage

This script demonstrates basic usage of the RobotSwarmSimulator:
- world creation
- agent configuration
- swarm spawning
- static and sensor-driven controllers
- simulation execution

The purpose of this script is to understand the RSS architecture and how
controllers and sensors interact with agent motion before implementing
custom behaviors (e.g. Lévy walk).
